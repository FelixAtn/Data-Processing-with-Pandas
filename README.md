# Data Processing with Pandas

This project demonstrates data processing techniques using Python's pandas library. It focuses on loading, analyzing, and manipulating CSV datasets. The project is structured in a step-by-step manner, covering various operations such as filtering, calculating averages, adding new columns, and exporting modified data.

## Project Context

This project was created as part of my **Software Engineering** studies module titled **Database and Big Data**. It reflects the practical application of data analysis concepts learned in the course and aims to demonstrate proficiency with handling and processing datasets, particularly using Python's `pandas` library.

## Features

1. **Loading CSV Data:** Load multiple CSV files and process them using an enum-based structure for organized file handling.
2. **Column Selection:** Extract and display specific columns from each dataset.
3. **Add New Columns:** Add custom columns to the datasets for further analysis.
4. **Filtering Data:** Display rows where any value in a column is above a specified threshold.
5. **Handle Missing Data:** Identify and fill missing values in the datasets.
6. **Sort Data:** Sort the datasets by specified columns in ascending order.
7. **Calculate Averages:** Compute the average of specific columns for each dataset.
8. **Exporting Modified Data:** Save the modified datasets to new CSV files.

## Technologies Used

- JupyterLab
- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and pandas installed (`pip install pandas`).
3. Place your CSV files in the project directory.
4. Run the script to see the output of each step.
5. The modified CSV files will be exported to the project folder after processing.

## Setup

1. Install Python: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install pandas: Open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. Run the project using:

    ```bash
    python data_processing_script.py
    ```
